* SÃ©bastien: quick summary on the star subtraction
- stars substraced, based on position in catalog, astroid not removed
- stars position to be provided if possible/light task to feed segmentation network or too complex/out scope ?
- use cleaned and not-cleaned images -> AI Sebastien
- flux and magnitude provided in SSDS catalogue -> used to compute M/L 
- try to avoid using too much metada not available for later images, keep it simple, extract from images

* Wouter: plans to refine the data preprocessing (and beyond)

* Stephan/Rares/Serge: first training exercises
. should add histogram to 3K cnn features
. from metadata using : width of image, size of pixel, assumption that M/L is instrisic property of galaxy ?
. should we select based on distance -> distance cut-off at 400

* Metric :
if ChiSq, need to use error (absolute or relative) or M/L error
what metric used in Zibetti
check to use log for M/L ratio or not ?
-> use weight to input error

* All: discuss and write down the main goals and methodology, including what exactly to predict, define main dataset, comparison with Zibetti-formalism,...

* All: discuss the immediate short term work to be done, including metric to evaluate, alternatives for data cleaning,...

* AOB

* Objective of the paper : 
- predict mass of galaxies based on 1 band picture and distance, use morphology to cope with missing data :
a) which precision with single band
b) 2nd model with g and i and uses flux to do Zibetti-like (recalibrated) -> AI Wouter

- true label comes images with different colors (Maxis? fitting)
- can't apply Zibetti directly
